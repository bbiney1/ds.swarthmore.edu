<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/suWOiEMsKHI0OB6H2" class="button button-red">Apply for Fall '16</a>

The library is now accepting applications for a brand new, funded program in digital scholarship for the fall semester.

Accepted students will have the opportunity to engage in theory and practice of digital scholarship, to collaborate on projects already in the works, and to develop their own projects.

The program involves a combination of open lab hours and weekly meetings, through which Fellows will gain:

- hands-on experience with web development basics, digital exhibits and data visualization
- an understanding of current conversations around digital environments from a variety of perspectives through readings and discussions
- experience in project management, design thinking and collaboration

### How much of a commitment will it be?

In order to qualify for funding, Fellows will be expected to contribute an average of 6 hours a week, including any discussion and workshops, though the schedule is flexible in order to accommodate for busier times of the semester. Some of the work will be new and exciting. Some of the work will be new and boring, as working with messy real world data sometimes is.

### Who should apply?

You! While priority will be given to Sophmores and Juniors, the application is open to all current students, all majors. The program assumes no background in computer science or web development, only a willingness to engage in self-directed learning and problem solving in a semi-structured setting. Applicants with some computer science but little or no web development experience are also encouraged to apply and if appropriate, may have the opportunity to pursue advanced topics.
