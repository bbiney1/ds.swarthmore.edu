<a  class="button button-red" href="https://goo.gl/forms/suWOiEMsKHI0OB6H2" target="_blank">Apply for Fall '16</a>

Interested in collaborative projects that span disciplinary boundaries, that bring networked technologies to bear on conventional scholarship, that demand a critical consideration of just what we mean by "the digital"?

The Libraries, in collaboration with the Center for Innovation and Leadership, are now accepting applications for a brand new program in digital scholarship for the fall semester. Accepted students will be funded for one semester to engage in theory and practice of digital scholarship, to collaborate on projects already in the works and to develop their own projects.

The program involves a combination of open lab hours and weekly meetings, through which Fellows will gain:

- hands-on experience with web development and design, digital media, text analysis and data visualization
- through readings and discussions, exposure to current conversations around digital environments from a variety of perspectives
- experience with project management, design thinking and tools for collaboration

### How much of a commitment will it be?

Though participants can anticipate a flexible and accommodating schedule, in order to qualify for funding, Fellows will be expected to contribute an average of 6 hours a week, including any discussion and lab meetings. Fair warning: Some of what will do you will be new and possibly exciting. Some of it will be new and potentially tedious, as working with messy real world data sometimes is.

### Who should apply?

You! While priority will be given to Sophomores and Juniors, the application is open to all current students, all majors. The program assumes no background in computer science or web development, only a willingness to engage in self-directed learning and problem solving in a semi-structured setting. Students with some computer science but little or no web development experience are also encouraged to apply, and if appropriate, may have the opportunity to pursue advanced topics.
