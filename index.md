<p>Digital Scholarship at Swarthmore encompasses a growing range of collaborative projects that, however disparate, share a set of commitments. They range freely across disciplines and across campus resources. They connect campus faculty, students and staff, as well as audiences and communities of practice beyond Swarthmore. They hinge on the critical use of digital networked technologies to engage in and document scholarly inquiry as a dynamic process.

<p>We regularly help with project planning at any stage of the process, whether a half articulated idea or the next phase of a competitive national grant. We work with faculty and students on projects of any scale, from classroom assignments to independent studies, from semester-long projects to multi-year, multi-institutional endeavors. Among other areas, we have expertise in data management, web development and design, data visualization, text analysis and project management.

We work closely with ITS, student centers, academic departments and others in order to provide or to locate the expertise and infrastructure necessary for most projects, regardless of department, regardless of apparent simplicity or complexity.
